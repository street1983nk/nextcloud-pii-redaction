# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution. PII Redaction is solo-maintained with hard
quality gates; small, focused pull requests get reviewed fastest.

## The shape of the repository

PII Redaction is a Nextcloud External App: a Python container (FastAPI) that
AppAPI deploys and reaches through HaRP. `src/pii_redaction/` holds the code,
`appinfo/info.xml` the store metadata, `l10n/` the German, English and French
catalogues.

## The gates

Green locally before you push:

```sh
uv sync
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
PYRIGHT_PYTHON_FORCE_VERSION=latest uv run pyright
uv run vulture src tests scripts --min-confidence 80
uv run pytest -q --cov=src/pii_redaction
```

## Pull requests

- One concern per pull request, with tests; a behaviour change without a test
  will be asked for one.
- Every user-visible text exists in German, English and French
  (`tests/test_trilingual.py`).
- No content leaves the server: no external service receives file content.
- The store texts (`appinfo/info.xml`) and the version travel with releases;
  do not change them in a feature pull request.
- Dependencies are locked in `uv.lock`; change it only through `uv` and say why.

## Security problems
