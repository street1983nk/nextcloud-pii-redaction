"""The admin settings page, declared to AppAPI instead of built as a frontend.

AppAPI renders a declarative form with Nextcloud's own components, so the page
follows theming, dark mode and high contrast without a line of CSS here. The
values of an admin form land in the app config of the ExApp (appconfig_ex), a
personal form would land in the user preferences (preferences_ex).

Every text below is the English source string. The German and French wording
lives in l10n/de.json and l10n/fr.json under exactly this text as the key, and
tests/test_trilingual.py holds the catalogues to this module.
