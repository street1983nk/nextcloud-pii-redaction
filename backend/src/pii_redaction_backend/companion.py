"""Is the PHP app there? The container side of the counterpart state (PLAT-02).

The PHP app (the companion) owns the file action, the jobs, the queue and the
job bound gateway; without it the container has nothing to work for and no
way to read a file. The container asks the handshake route of the PHP app at
its start and every five minutes (nc.fetch_handshake) and keeps one of three
states:

- ``ok``: the PHP app answered 200 with a version that looks like a version.
  Whether that version matches this backend (lockstep) is judged by /status,
  which shows both.
- ``missing``: the PHP app answered 404 (not installed or not enabled) or 403
  (it does not take this container for its backend), or the instance could
  not be reached three times in a row.
- ``unknown``: nothing asked yet, an answer without a valid version, fewer
  than three failures in a row, or a 412 because AppAPI has not enabled this
  container yet (it asks at its start, before the enable call arrives).

The runner only claims work while the state is ``ok`` (``may_work``).
A change of state is logged once, with the state and a reason code only; no
URL, no path, no answer content.
