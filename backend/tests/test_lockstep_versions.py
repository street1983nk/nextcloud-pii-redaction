"""The version numbers of a release and the server window, held together.

Taken over from Findling's test_lockstep_versions.py. Both halves of this app
carry the same version and are released as a pair, so nobody ends up with a PHP
app and a container that disagree about the protocol between them. Four places
state that version:

* ``<version>`` in ``php/appinfo/info.xml``, the version of the PHP app,
* ``<version>`` in ``backend/appinfo/info.xml``, the version of the ExApp,
* ``<image-tag>`` in ``backend/appinfo/info.xml``, the tag the deploy daemon pulls,
* ``version`` in ``backend/pyproject.toml``, the version of the Python package.

The second gate holds the server window: both info.xml declare the same
``<nextcloud min-version max-version>``, and the matrix of deploy-harp.yml runs
exactly the majors of that window, no more and no fewer.

No number is demanded anywhere: a gate that pinned one would be edited at the
next bump without the equality ever being checked. Every rule has a self test
with a staged sample, so a gate whose body was deleted cannot stay green (the
anti vacuity clause of Findling).
